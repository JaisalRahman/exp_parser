Mathemetical expression parser

This is a command line interface for exp_parser library similar to wcalc
It is licsenced under GPLV3

For readline library support #define HAVE_READLINE_H

Its uses mpreal.h header as a wrapper for mpfr arbitary percision library
For more information about mpreal read its README file

	Supports basic mathematical operators like

	^  power
	*  multiplication
	/  division
	+  addition
	-  subtraction

	listed in order of precedence

	( ) can be used used to group expression

	also supports unary plus '+' and unary minus '-'

	Supports implicit multiplication operator
	i.e: '*' can be omitted in expressions like a*(b) or (a)*b

	Roots can be calculated using decimal power or fraction
	eg : 
		2^(1/5)
		=1.41421
		(or)
		2^0.5
		=1.41421

	Support variables
		- Variable name should start with alphabet and can contain numbers

		- Variables can be declared by the statement variable=expression in the expression string

	Supports functions
	
	Value of previous expression can be obtained using pre-defined variable 'a'
